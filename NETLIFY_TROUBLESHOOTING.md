# 🔍 Netlify Troubleshooting Guide

## Let's diagnose your specific issue step by step:

### 🎯 Step 1: Check Build Status
1. Go to your **Netlify dashboard**
2. Click on your **site name**
3. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
4. Look at the **latest deploy**:
   - ✅ **Green "Published"** = Build succeeded
   - ❌ **Red "Failed"** = Build failed
   - 🟡 **Yellow "Building"** = Still processing

**If build failed:**
- Click on the failed deploy
- Check the **build logs** for error messages
- Common issues:
  - Wrong Node.js version
  - Missing dependencies
  - Build command errors

### 🎯 Step 2: Check Build Logs
**Click on your latest deploy** and look for:

**✅ Success indicators:**
```
✔ Installing NPM modules using NPM version 8.19.2
✔ NPM modules installed
✔ Started restoring cached build plugins
✔ Finished restoring cached build plugins
✔ Started executing command: npm run build
✔ Finished executing command: npm run build
✔ Deploy is live!
```

**❌ Failure indicators:**
```
✘ Build script returned non-zero exit code: 1
✘ npm ERR! 
✘ Error during NPM install
✘ Command failed with exit code 1
```

### 🎯 Step 3: Test Your Live Site
**Visit your Netlify URL** (something like `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`):

**✅ What should work:**
- Main page loads with "Play Solo" and "Multiplayer Race" buttons
- Solo game works perfectly
- Lobby page loads but shows "WebSocket Server Not Deployed" error

**❌ What indicates problems:**
- 404 "Page Not Found" 
- Blank white page
- "Build failed" message
- JavaScript errors in browser console

### 🎯 Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Build Failed"
**Solution:** Check build command in Netlify settings:
- Should be: `npm run build`
- NOT: `node server.js`

#### Issue: "404 Page Not Found"
**Solution:** Check publish directory:
- Should be: `dist`
- Your netlify.toml should handle redirects

#### Issue: "Blank Page"
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12):
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Often indicates missing files or syntax errors

#### Issue: "Solo game doesn't work"
**Solution:** 
- Check that all files are in `dist/` folder
- Verify no JavaScript syntax errors
- Check that `styles.css` and `game.js` are loading

#### Issue: "Multiplayer shows connection error"
**Expected behavior!** You need to:
1. Deploy WebSocket server to Railway/Render
2. Update `config.js` with server URL
3. Push changes

### 🎯 Step 5: Quick Checks

Run these checks and tell me the results:

1. **Netlify Build Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / 🟡 Building
2. **Site loads**: ✅ Yes / ❌ No
3. **Solo game works**: ✅ Yes / ❌ No  
4. **Browser console errors**: ✅ None / ❌ Has errors
5. **Specific error message**: [Tell me what you see]

### 🎯 Step 6: Emergency Fix

If nothing works, try this:
1. **In Netlify dashboard** → Site settings → Build & deploy
2. **Clear cache** and redeploy
3. **Check environment**: Node.js 18 or higher
4. **Verify repository** is connected correctly

## 🆘 Share These Details:

Please share:
1. **Your Netlify site URL**
2. **Build status** (success/failed)
3. **Any error messages** from build logs
4. **What happens** when you visit the site
5. **Browser console errors** (press F12 → Console tab)

With this info, I can give you the exact fix! 🚀
