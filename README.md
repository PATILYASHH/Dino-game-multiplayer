## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. **Fork/Clone this repository**
2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect and deploy the static files
3. **Domain**: Your game will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### WebSocket Server Deployment Options

Since Vercel doesn't support WebSocket servers, choose one of these options:

#### Option A: Railway (Recommended)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository  
3. Add environment variable: `PORT=8080`
4. Deploy - Railway will automatically detect Node.js
5. Get your WebSocket URL: `wss://your-app.railway.app`

#### Option B: Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service from your repository
3. Set build command: `npm install`
4. Set start command: `npm start`
5. Get your WebSocket URL: `wss://your-app.onrender.com`

#### Option C: Heroku
1. Install Heroku CLI
2. `heroku create your-dino-server`
3. `git push heroku main`
4. Get WebSocket URL: `wss://your-dino-server.herokuapp.com`

### Update WebSocket URL

After deploying your WebSocket server, update the connection URL in your code:

1. **Edit `game.js`** (line ~262):
```javascript
// Replace localhost with your deployed WebSocket URL
this.ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-websocket-server.railway.app');
```

2. **Edit `lobby.js`** (similar update needed)

## 🎮 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start WebSocket server
npm start

# Serve static files (in another terminal)
python -m http.server 3000

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Game Architecture

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (deployed on Vercel)
- **WebSocket Server**: Node.js with 'ws' library (deployed separately)
- **Real-time Sync**: Deterministic RNG for synchronized multiplayer
- **State Management**: WebSocket message passing for game events
