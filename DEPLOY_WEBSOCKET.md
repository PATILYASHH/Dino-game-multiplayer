# ðŸš€ Railway WebSocket Server Deployment

## Quick Deploy Your WebSocket Server

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository: `Dino-game-multiplayer`
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect Node.js
   - Run `npm install`
   - Start with `npm start` (which runs your server.js)
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
7. Railway will give you a URL like: `https://your-project-12345.railway.app`

### Step 2: Test Your WebSocket Server
- Your WebSocket URL will be: `wss://your-project-12345.railway.app`
- Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step

### Step 3: Update Your Netlify Site
- Once you get your Railway URL, I'll help you update the config

## Alternative: Render Deployment
If Railway doesn't work, we can use Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Build Command: `npm install`  
5. Start Command: `npm start`
6. Wait for deployment
7. Get your URL: `https://your-project.onrender.com`

## After You Deploy
Come back with your WebSocket server URL and I'll update your config!
